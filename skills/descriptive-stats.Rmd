This page illustrates some skills that will be useful to you
as you learn to describe variables in a dataset

For the R examples, I'll be using the following packages and load a dataset
called `my_data`.


```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(here)

my_data <- here("datasets",
             "test.csv") |>
  read_csv() 

```


# Descriptive statistics

You may want to describe your data with descriptive statistics.

## Mean

The *mean* is the average value of a variable. It is a measure of 
central tendency that is sensitive to outliers.

### R

The function in R that will calculate a mean is called `mean()`.

```{r}
mean(my_data$`sales-price`)
```
### Excel

In Excel, the function is `AVERAGE()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-mean.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Standard deviation

The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the
data are. It is sensitive to outliers.

### R 

In R, the function `sd()` will calculate a standard deviation.

```{r}
sd(my_data$`sales-price`)
```


### Excel

In Excel, the function to calculate a standard deviation is `STDEV.P()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-stdev.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Median and other percentiles

Percentiles are the values that a specified percentage of observations
of a variable are lower than. The 50th percentile is also called the 
median: It's the value that half of all observations are less than.

The median is measure of central tendency that is not sensitive to 
outliers.

The range between lower and upper percentiles can be a useful measure
of central tendency. For example, the interquartile range (IQR) is the range
between the 25th and 75th percentile. Half of all values fall within
this range.

### R

In R, you can calculate a percentile with the function `quantile()`. The median is the 50th percentile.

```{r}
quantile(my_data$`sales-price`, probs = 0.5)
```

You can also calculate the 25th and 75th percentiles.

```{r}
quartiles <- quantile(my_data$`sales-price`, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))

quartiles
```

And the difference between them is the interquartile range.

```{r}
IQR = quartiles["75%"] - quartiles["25%"]

as.numeric(IQR)
```

### Excel

In Excel, the function to calculate percentiles is 
`PERCENTILE.EXC()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-pctile.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Proportions

Averages and standard deviations don't make sense for categorical variables.
The appropriate descriptive statistics would be proportions.

### R

In R, you can use the `table()` function to get the number of observations
in each category.

```{r}
table(my_data$building)
```

And then you can express these as proportions by dividing those numbers
by the number of observations.

```{r}
table(my_data$building) / nrow(my_data)
```

### Excel

If you've set up a column for each category, where a value of 1 means
the observation is in that category and a value of zero means it is not,
the average of one of those columns is the proportion of observations
within that category. 

You can use an `IF()` function in Excel to convert categories to zeros 
and ones.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "prop-calc-excel.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```


# Confidence intervals

In general, the data sets you work with represent *samples* of 
larger *populations*. Your goal is to be able to generalize from
your sample to the population.

Sometimes this is literally and obviously true. For example, you might
have sent a survey to one percent of all Canadian households, and you
want to analyze the data to make some claims about the characteristics
of Canadian households in general.

Other times, describing your sample in terms of the population it comes
from is not as obvious. For example, you might have data about every 
county in the United States suggesting that incomes are higher in urban
counties than in rural counties. You might argue that this is not a sample, 
because you have data on every county that exists. *However*,
if you want to claim that this difference is based on a fundamental 
difference that is likely to always exist between urban and rural counties
in the United States, then you need to be able to *generalize* this difference
to a broader population, which would be 
*all hypothetical counties that could ever exist in the United States.*

## Confidence intervals for averages

A confidence interval for an average is a range of values that you can
have a specified level of confidence that the the average value for the 
*full population* falls within. A *one-sample t-test* is a method for
calculating a confidence interval.

### R

Here is how you would do a one-sample t-test in R.

```{r}
t.test(my_data$`sales-price`)
```

By default, the `t.test` function returns a 95-percent confidence interval,
but you can also specify other confidence levels. Here is how you would
get the 99-percent confidence level.

```{r}
t.test(my_data$`sales-price`,
       conf.level = 0.99)
```

### Excel

To calculate the 95-percent confidence interval in Excel, 
you'd need to know that the confidence margin is
the standard deviation times the z-score corresponding to
the confidence level you want. 

So, first you calculate the standard deviation of the sample.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-stdev.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Then you calculate the z-score for the desired confidence level
using the function `NORM.INV.S()`. The probability you should 
use for a 95% confidence level is 0.975. Or, if you use a 
probability of 0.025, you'll get the opposite (i.e. negative) of
the z-score you need.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-z-score.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Now you can calculate the upper and lower bounds of the 
confidence interval.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-conf-int.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Confidence intervals for proportions

Confidence intervals for proportions work the same way as confidence intervals
for averages, but you use the standard error of the proportion instead of the 
standard deviation.

### R

In R, you use prop.test rather than t.test when you want to find the 
confidence interval for a proportion.

```{r}
prop.test(x = sum(my_data$building == "Single-family"),
          n = nrow(my_data))
```


### Excel

To calculate the 95-percent confidence interval in Excel, 
you'd need to know that the confidence margin is
the standard error times the z-score corresponding to
the confidence level you want. 

The standard error is given by the equation:

$$
S.E. = \sqrt{\frac{p\times(1-p)}{n}}
$$

Where _p_ is the proportion and _n_ is the number of observations. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "prop-test.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Then you calculate the z-score and the upper and lower bounds of the 
confidence interval as you would for a continuous variable.

# Visualizing data

You might find it useful to visualize a variable in your dataset using
a histogram, and one-dimensional scatterplot, or a bar chart.

## Histogram

A histogram is a useful way to visualize the distribution of
a continuous variable.

### R

In R (ggplot2), `geom_histogram` will generate a histogram.

Here, I'll visualize the distribution of a variable in my dataset called 
"store size."

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = `sales-price`),
                 bins = 40) +
  theme_linedraw()
```


### Excel

You can create a histogram in Excel using the data analysis 
tool pack. By default, it will put gaps between the bars. It is 
more common to show histograms without these gaps, so you can 
remove them.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "excel-hist.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## One-dimesional scatterplot

A one-dimentional scatteplot can be a much more literal representation
of the the distribution of a dataset.

### R

In R, you can use `geom_jitter()` to generate a scattplot. You can set
the x-coordinate as the variable you want to visualize, and set the 
y-coordinate as a constant, and R will randomly vary the y positions.

You might want to turn off the y-axis labels since they'll be meaningless.

You might also want to make the points a little bit transparent to avoid
overplotting.

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = `sales-price`, y = 0),
              alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y =  element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank())
```


### Excel

In Excel, to acheive that same effect, you need to create a fake y-variable
that varies randomly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "prop-random-gen.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Then you can create a scatterplot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "scatter-plot.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Bar charts

You might use a bar chart to represent proportions.

### R

In R, you can use `geom_bar()` to represent proportions with a 
stacked bar chart.

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = building, x = 1),
           position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Proportion",
                     breaks = c(0.2,
                                0.4,
                                0.6,
                                0.8,
                                1),
                     labels = c("20%",
                                "40%",
                                "60%",
                                "80%",
                                "100%")) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x =  element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
```


```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = building)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = breaks <- c(2000, 4000, 6000),
                     labels = paste0(100*breaks / nrow(my_data), "%"),
                     name = "Percentage") +
  theme_linedraw() 
```

You can also calculate the proportions and their confidence intervals 
and make a little table for them like this.

```{r}
prop_summary <- my_data |>
  mutate(single_family = building == "Single-family",
         duplex = building == "Duplex",
         three_plus = building == "Three-plus") |>
  select(single_family, 
         duplex, 
         three_plus) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "which_building",
               values_to = "is_type") |>
  group_by(which_building) |>
  summarise(Proportion = mean(is_type),
            `C.I. Low` = prop.test(x = sum(is_type==1),
                                   n = n(), 
                                   conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int[1],
            `C.I. High` = prop.test(x = sum(is_type==1),
                                   n = n(), 
                                   conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int[2])

prop_summary
```

And then we can use that to make a bar chart with error bars

```{r}
ggplot(prop_summary,
       aes(x = which_building,
           y = Proportion)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = `C.I. Low`,
                    ymax = `C.I. High`)) +
  theme_linedraw()
```

### Excel

In Excel, if you set up a little table with the proportions and margins of error
like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "prop-test-setup.png") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```


You can create a bar chart like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "bar-plot.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```


And add error bars like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "error-bars.gif") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

## A little shortcut

You can download a couple of helpful R functions here:
https://github.com/c-voulgaris/GSD-SES-5215-F24/blob/main/sample%20assignments/descriptive%20statistics/helpers.R

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
here("skills",
     "gifs",
     "github-download.png") |>
  knitr::include_graphics()
```

Save it to your project folder and add this line of code to the top of your
script (or RMarkdown or Quarto file), right after where you load all your
libraries. Use the `here()` function to indicate where in your project folder
you have saved the `helpers.R` script

```{r}
here("sample assignments",
     "descriptive statistics",
     "helpers.R") |>
  source()
```

Now you have two functions you can use:

`descriptive_histogram` will generate a histogram with the labels for 
descriptive statistics. You need to specify the variable, labels for the x an y
axes, and the number of decimal places you want to include on all numbers.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
distance_histogram <- descriptive_histogram(my_data$city_dist,
                                         label_x = "city_dist",
                                         label_y = "Number of home sales",
                                         decimal_places = 2)

distance_histogram
```

You can optionally display the histogram with a log-transformed x-axis.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
distance_histogram <- descriptive_histogram(my_data$city_dist,
                                         label_x = "Distance from city (miles)",
                                         label_y = "Number of home sales",
                                         decimal_places = 2,
                                         is_log = TRUE)

distance_histogram
```

`descriptive_cat_bars` will give you a bar chart with error bars and labels.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
type_plot <- descriptive_cat_bars(my_data$building,
                                  x_label = "Type of building",
                                  y_label = "Proportion of homes")

type_plot
```
